Initial Thoughts
================

This webapp will be a re-placement for the "Prescription pad" on the doctor's desk. The app may store other info like the data of patients for whom the patients for which the prescriptions were made. Also, if required one can also list the history of a patient ( enlist all the prescriptions for a patient).

All this doesn't have to be complicated. The major screen will be the prescription screen. The UI has to be clean and user centric not computer centric.

Inspiration
============

My mother got a tennis elbow and so I took her to Dr. Tushar Mankand. He had this software which I guess had a feature of writing prescriptions also but it didn't have mom's record and so to add it ( so as to make the prescription ), it took him 15~20 clicks. Finally the prescription was made the old fashion way.

Now, before the computer thing, it was so simple:

* There is this pad on the table
* Write the patient's name, age , diagnosis and the medicines.
* Tear it off the page, put it in the file
* Then, on the next visit patient brings the file for history reference.
